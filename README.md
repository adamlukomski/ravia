# RAVIA - Reproducible research project

This is the main repository of the RAVIA project,
that aims to be a small collection of models and
control methods for nonlinear systems.

The goal was to gather as many ready to use
simulations in one place as possible, mainly to simplify
research, because in a lot of cases writing a working
model takes a painful amount of time.

Most files sacrifice robustness for clarity and stick
with nearly pure mathematic equations. I will try to use
either simplified notation or Latex notation for equations.

I will try to add citations and sources where possible
(and where to find further information), but if I miss
something let me know.
